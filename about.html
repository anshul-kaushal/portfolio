        <h3>Hi, I’m Anshul Kaushal. I’m a web developer and a UX/UI designer</h3>
        <p>I love to collaborate with businesses and help them in establishing a digital presence or enhancing it to fuel their growth even further. I cherish the opportunity to meet new people, understand their perspective and adopt their ambitions and aspirations for their business venture as my own. This attitude comes from my cautious approach to deal with individuals with an empathetic mindset.</p>
        <p>While I’ve worked on numerous projects in the past and always keep creating new things to broaden my horizon and learn more, I don’t prefer to define myself based on my past achievements or accolades, but on my ability to utilize the opportunities that the future brings forth. </p>
        <p>While I’ve worked on numerous projects in the past and always keep creating new things to broaden my horizon and learn more, don’t prefer to define myself based on my past achievements or accolades, but on my ability to utilize the opportunities that the future brings forth.</p>
        <p>I’m always keen on learning new things and learning how to play a piano is still unchecked on my bucket list. I also like writing music and have a song of my own released on Spotify. I enjoy the prospects of reading a book but always struggle to finish them off. There’s still some room for improvement in that department.</p>
        <p>Though I’ve listed some of the specific skills I possess and can harness to help your business grow via a digital platform below, I’m not limited by these alone. I’m always striving to learn new things and am currently learning about data analytics, data modelling and digital marketing.</p>
